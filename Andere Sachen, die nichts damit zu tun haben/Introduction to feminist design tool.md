# An introduction to the Feminist Design Tool

von FutureLearn

Let’s explore how Feminist Internet have built on Josie’s work on the feminist chatbot design process, combining it with their own research and their use of her process in a number of workshops.

Over time, this work has evolved into a process called the Feminist Design Tool. You’ll be using sections of this tool to help you design your own chatbot later in the course.

The Feminist Design Tool has eight sections. Each section includes questions that aim to help designers consider the values they are embedding in their products or services. By thinking these questions through, designers have a better chance of ensuring that they don’t knowingly or unknowingly perpetuate gender biases or inequalities in the things they make.

You’ll use six sections of the Feminist Design Tool as you design your own chatbot during the rest of the course. The full version of the tool includes sections on ‘data’ and ‘architecture’. These are important, but they relate to later stages of the chatbot development process which will not be part of your chatbot design project.

Let’s review the sections of the Feminist Design Tool that we’ll use during the course. You can also download the full version of the tool using the link at the bottom of this step.

## 1. Stakeholders

The idea of ‘universal users’ has become very popular in interaction design. It means designing for ‘everyone’, which sounds good, but in practice it can mean that people with specific needs are overlooked in favour of mainstream groups. This is because designers don’t always consider the people who are not currently well served by mainstream products and services. If you address the needs of people who are not currently well served, you are more likely to design something that works for everyone. A good example of this is wheelchair ramps - they make buildings accessible to people who both use, and don’t use Wheelchairs. In addition, the term ‘user’ itself can be seen as problematic. It positions a person’s use of a product or service above other aspects of their lived reality, and doesn’t acknowledge their potential for active participation in the production of technologies. We prefer the term ‘stakeholders’, which emphasises the idea that we all have a stake in the technologies we use, and are active participants in constructing their social meaning and value. Alternatively, you can simply use ‘person’ or ‘people’!

## 2. Purpose

Technologies are built for many reasons, and can have many beneficial or harmful consequences for people. This tool is about encouraging you to design technologies that improve, rather than damage, social, environmental and economic outcomes. This starts with defining the purpose of the thing you want to make, and considering whether it is beneficial for the world.

## 3. Context

Technology is not isolated from political, social, economic, cultural, technological, legal and environmental power dynamics. For example, facial recognition technology is currently being used by police services in the context of a history of police discrimination towards black communities.

## 4. Bias

We all come from places and experiences that have shaped our thinking and perspectives, and we tend to unconsciously embed these perspectives in the things we make. The risk of not reflecting on this is that your design may reinforce negative stereotypes about particular groups of people, which could be harmful.

## 5. Design and Representation

The way AI agents (chatbots, game characters etc) are designed and represented can challenge or reinforce stereotypes. For example, characterising a financial advice bot as male could reinforce the stereotype that finances and money management are ‘masculine’ activities. This tool encourages you to consider how you are planning to depict or represent your design to the people who will use it.

## 6. Conversation Design

Whenever conversation is the primary interface between your design and the people who are going to use it, the dialogue needs to be carefully crafted. This is how people will decide whether the design is effective, and also how it might harm or discriminate against them. A feminist approach to conversation design means using empathic, inclusive, accessible language and images, and providing opportunities for the user to specify how they would like to be addressed. You can find out more about accessible language using the link at the bottom of the step.


# Beispiel
We’ve also looked at how designing for ‘universal users’ can mean that people with specific needs, especially those that are not currently well served, are not considered by designers. For example, crash test dummies that have been designed only using male body dimensions do not serve women well, because their needs are different; their body shapes and sizes require a different kind of design. Not testing airbags and seatbelts using crash test dummies with female body dimensions means that women are more likely than men to die in car crashes (1). #Beispiel

- to design and prototype a chatbot that improves, rather than damages, social, environmental or economic outcomes.

# ChatBot
Beispiel Reflection on #Bias
1. How might your own values and position in society compare to those of your stakeholder group?
2. Have you made any assumptions about your stakeholder group? Might you have any unconscious biases about them?
3. Have you thought about how any assumptions you have made could reinforce stereotypes about your stakeholder group?

### Questions for Stakeholder
1. Can you be more specific about the group you’re designing for?
2. Might people in this group have any specific needs or face any specific barriers and problems?
3. What are the strengths and viewpoints of people in this group?

### Questions for Purpose
1. Can you ask anyone in your stakeholder group if they agree that your chatbot would be helpful to them?
2. Can you ask anyone in your stakeholder group if they agree that the chatbot would encourage equality, wellbeing or positive social change?
3. How will your chatbot address the needs of the stakeholder group?

You then put your learning into practice, using questions from the Feminist Design Tool to help you to identify a purpose for your own chatbot that improves, rather than damages social, environmental or economic outcomes. #Formulierung

First of all you look to define a group / stakeholder and then a purpose. Then you go through the questions to unbias your idea and persona.
Give your chatbot a personality, a tone and characteristics as well as 

### According to Google’s guidelines, conversation design is

> “a design language based on human conversation. The more an interface leverages human conversation, the less users have to be taught how to use it. It’s a synthesis of several design disciplines, including voice user interface design, interaction design, visual design, motion design, audio design, and UX writing.”

Google describe the role of a conversation designer as like that of an architect,

> “mapping out what users can do in a space, while considering both the user’s needs and the technological constraints. They curate the conversation, defining the flow and its underlying logic in a detailed design specification that represents the complete user experience. They partner with stakeholders and developers to iterate on the designs and bring the experience to life.”

Conversation designers creating a scripted chatbot need to write everything the chatbot says, as well as every response they want the user to be able to choose from.

## The challenges of a conversation
- not be too formal or too funny
- Also man hat nicht nur eine Antwort, sondern verschiedene Antwortmöglichkeiten
- text-based video games können dabei eine große Hilfe sein ( beschäftigte dich damit)

My Chatbot, puts the user in a better mood than before. Giving random jokes or things I like about that person.
Its a chatbot that expresses the feeling or makes the person feel better


## How feminist design can be different
-   How might feminist conversation design be different from more mainstream conversation design?
-   What might the designer consider when writing their chatbot script?
-   Would they face more or fewer challenges?
-   What might make their conversation design beneficial for users?

it’s helpful to think in more detail about the kind of situation your stakeholders might be in, what their world is like, and how your chatbot could make it better.

## What makes a good #storyboard?
A good storyboard thinks about the product or service from the perspective of the person using it. It’s more important that you are able to empathise with the person, putting yourself in their shoes, and that you tell a clear story.

Here are some features that a good storyboard should include.
### Character
    
    Your stakeholder is the main character in the story. Try to convey their behaviours, appearance, expectations and decisions throughout the storyboard. The more you can reveal about what is going on in their mind, the better.
    
 ### Scene
    
    The story should be set in a real-world context involving place and people.
	
- What situation is the person in when they need to use the chatbot?
- Where are they?
- How are they feeling?
    
 ### Trigger
    
    The story should include a trigger that shows what motivates the stakeholder to interact with the product or service.
	
-   What triggers them to use the chatbot?
-   What problem do they need help with?
    
 ### Interaction
    
    The story should show how the stakeholder interacts with the product or service and how they feel during the interaction.
    
 ### Change
    
    Finish the story by conveying the benefit of the solution, or a problem that the character is left with.
	
- How do they use the chatbot?
- How will they feel when using it?
    

To make your story powerful, software developer Nick Babich suggests also considering the following concepts.

  ### Authenticity
    
    “Keep the focus on real humans in real contexts, and your audience will empathise with them.”
    
 ### Simplicity
    
    “Cut out any unnecessary extras. No matter how good a sentence, picture, or page may be, if it doesn’t add value to the overall message, you should remove it.”
    
### Emotion
    
    “It’s essential to communicate the emotional state of your character throughout their experience.”
	
Add emojis, symbols or other diagrams to each step in your storyboard to help others to understand how the person using the chatbot might be feeling and what they might be thinking. You can use these visual elements to convey how the person might react when they use the chatbot, and how the interaction affects them.

## Create your own Storyboard

# Chatbots Personality Creation
### Step 1

Brainstorm a list of adjectives (e.g., friendly, technologically competent). Focus on the qualities you want people to perceive when talking to your chatbot.

### Step 2

Narrow your list down to 4-6 key adjectives that describe your chatbot’s core personality traits.

### Step﻿  3

Come up with a few different characters that embody these qualities (e.g., a barista, a fashion icon, a world traveler). Your chatbot character doesn’t have to be a person. It could also be an anthropomorphised animal, an alien, an artificial intelligence, a cartoon character, etc.

> **Feminist Design Tool prompt:** The way technologies depict humans and represent gender can challenge or reinforce stereotypes. Does your character choice reinforce any stereotypes? For example, characterising a financial advice bot as male could reinforce the stereotype that men are more competent than women with money.

## Step﻿  4

Choose one character that best embodies your chatbot and write a short description, no more than a paragraph. This description should provide a clear sense of what this character is like, especially what it would say, write, or do.

> **Feminist Design Tool prompt:** A feminist approach to chatbot design means using empathic, inclusive, accessible language and images, and providing opportunities for the user to specify how they would like to be addressed. What kinds of character traits might reflect this? Remember, your character doesn’t have to be a feminist or promote feminism, but its language should reflect feminist values.

### Step﻿  5

Find, or create, an image or two that visually represents your character. Pictures are a great memory aid and can help you keep the character in mind when writing dialogue.

> **Feminist Design Tool prompt:** Will you assign a gender to your chatbot? Why? In what ways might this reinforce or challenge gender stereotypes? In what ways might this prompt your user to behave unethically or in a prejudiced way? Have you considered a genderless chatbot? What possibilities might this open up for your design?

Once you have worked through all the steps, post your descriptive paragraph in the discussion below. You could also write a couple of sentences about how your choices were informed by the Feminist Design Tool prompts. What do you think of other learners’ chatbot characters? Do they express the design tool principles

# Tipps
- vorher einfach die Konversation skizzieren, via Sticky Notes, da es später einfacher ist die Sticky Notes besser anzuordnen
>  You don’t want the chatbot to deliver anything longer than a couple of sentences, because this can cause the chatbot to dominate the conversation. 
- zwei Farben verwenden: Eine Farbe für den Chatbot, die andere für die Person

## What should my draft script include?

-   **A greeting remark** – How will your chatbot introduce itself? It can be nice to include a friendly emoji at the beginning of the conversation too.
-   **An explanation of your chatbot’s purpose** – How does the chatbot introduce what it is there to help with?
-   **An interaction showing the scenario you outlined in your storyboard**– How will the chatbot’s function be realised through the conversation?
-   **A closing statement** – How will the chatbot let the person know the conversation is over?


## CheckIn for Chatbot
-   Are there any words your chatbot should avoid using? Could anything trigger or be upsetting for the person chatting with it?
-   Are you using empathic, inclusive, accessible language and images? You can find out more about accessible language using the link at the bottom of the step.
-   Could you get feedback from your stakeholder group about whether the conversation you’ve drafted is appropriate?
