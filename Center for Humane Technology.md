- Value Exercise Sheet
- SDG Goals mit Fragen, wie:
	- Which of these goals are most important to you?
	-  Which challenges represented by these goals have you experienced personally (directly or indirectly)?
	-  Which challenges have you been spared from?
	-  Which issues have affected your loved ones or communities you care about?
	-  What role should technology play in achieving the goals you care about most?

# Module 1: Setting the Stage
## The Need for Humane Technology
Aktuelle Probleme dieser Welt sind
- growing wealth inequality
- declining mental health
- catastrophic impacts of climate change
- entrenched system driven by those with power exploiting those

More than ever, we need technology that builds - rather that undermines - our capacity to face complex threats!

As technologist, we get to decide ->
- will we strengthen our users and society so humanity can face these challenges?
- Will we invent tech that assists us in working on global challenges?

or will we instead choose to use our power without mindfulness of the consequences and accelerate catastrophic risks?

Imagine if technology 
* treated our attention and intentions as sacred -> rather than artificially directing our desires and extracting our attention
* was more accountable to those affected by it -> rather than accountable to those who profit from it
* helped us make wise choices -> rather than leaving us hopeless and helpless in the face of catastrophic news feeds
* facilitated more resilient digital democracies -> rather than leaving us with the false choise of authorianism or chaos
* enhanced our shared understanding, allowing deep collaboration on global challenges -> rather than distracting us, dividing us, making us dysfunctional

## The Tradeoffs of technology
- technology develops faster than our ability to regulate it or understand its long-term effects
- as technology develops, it becomes more powerful, cheaper, and more widely accessible
	- can be a good thing, but it also means we are rapidly disseminating technology with dangerous, exponentially advancing applications
- we must meet the urgency of these challenges with unprecedented human capacity
- out best technological minds must create products that serve humanity. And yet, current systems incetivize most technologists to work on marginally useful, and often harmful products
	- we need to focus attention on what matters like never before
	- we need the capacity to find shared understanding like never before
	- we need to solve problems collaboratively like never before (!)

We cannot meet these challenges, if our technology distracts us, divides us, and downgrades our collective ability to solve problems (!)
- reorient our tools to increase our attention spans, support collective collaboration, and help us navigate catastrophic risks

## Intervening in the system
In order to help mitigate catastrophic risks, humane technologists need to consider the whole system that technology exists within— and affects. This includes:

-   Identifying the harms of technology visible in our daily lives.
-   Tracking the causes which precede and follow those harms, such as:
    -   Elements of human cognition.
    -   Social structures like law, governance, and economics.
    -   Assumptions of current cultural paradigms.

Definition Persuasive Technology
- use scientifically tested design strategies to manipulate human behaviour towards a desired goal like increasing time on site or user engagenment 
- creation & amplification of these technologies have been called "the race to the bottom of the brain stem"


Harms of persuasive technology include:
-   Degradation of mental health, such as:
    -   Addiction and compulsive behavior
    -   Diminished attention, cognition, and intentionality
-   Pollution of our information environment
-   Political hyper-polarization
-   Widespread fraud and exploitation, from identity theft to human trafficking
-   Human rights abuses facilitated through surveillance and propaganda
-   Threats and attacks on people’s physical safety
-   The rise of influencer culture and its effects on our youth

-> these are not seperate problems - they result from interactions between our tools, cognition, culture, and social strucutres

## The TradeOffs of Technology

> The real problem of humanity is the following: we have paleolithic emotions, medieval institutions; and god-like technology." – Dr. E.O. Wilson, Sociobiologist

**Technology is extremely profitable, so it often develops faster than our ability to regulate it or understand its long-term effects.**

**As technology develops, it becomes more powerful, cheaper, and more widely accessible. This is often highly beneficial, but it also means we are rapidly disseminating technology with dangerous, exponentially advancing applications.**

Consider a few other examples of technological #tradeoffs :
-   Industrial technologies like the steam engine radically raised productive capacities, and they also led to unprecedented worker exploitation, massive ecological degradation, and the climate crisis.
-   Biomedical technologies like gene editing (CRISPR) will revolutionize personalized, affordable healthcare but also increase the accessibility of bioweapon creation, not to mention genetically modified babies tailor-made for the world’s wealthiest.    
-   Digital technologies like recommendation algorithms can understand personal preferences with previously unimaginable precision, and often lead to unprecedented attention extraction and related harms 

These technological tradeoffs introduce increasing fragility to risks like disinformation, ecological collapse, pandemics, human migration, and the resulting public fear and disenfranchisement.

_Persuasive technologies_ use scientifically tested design strategies to manipulate human behavior towards a desired goal like increasing time on site or user engagement. The creation and amplification of these technologies have been called “the race to the bottom of the brain stem.”
